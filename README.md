# 🏫 School Projects  
A compilation of individual and collaborative projects I’ve worked on during my studies.

## **📐 Computational Thinking in Design**

### 🛠️ Tools & Software:
- **Rhinoceros** – CAD software  
- **Grasshopper** – Visual scripting for CAD using Python  
- **Ultimaker Cura** – 3D printing slicer

   A project combining geometric shapes and extrusions, controlled by various input variables to modify length and shape.  

   - **Color Mapping**: The colors were determined based on the extrusion angles, ranging from 0 to 360 degrees.  
   - **Animation**: Using sine and cosine functions plotted against time, I generated an oscillating motion within Rhinoceros, creating a dynamic and flowing animation.

  A Fibonacci sequence-inspired design that integrates mathematical principles with artistic aesthetics.  

  - **Fibonacci Sequence**: The increasing square sizes and spirals mirror the Fibonacci sequence's proportions.  
  - **Sine Function**: Rippling effects were achieved using sine functions, simulating the expanding, concentric nature of a ripple, visually echoing the sequence.

## **💡 Design Thinking and Innovation**

### 🛠️ Tools & Software:
- **Flask** – Web server framework  
- **Raspberry Pi & Python** – Hardware programming  
- **AdaFruit Neopixels** – LED light display  
- **Canva, Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop** – Poster design  

### 👥 Group Project: **StrideSync**

  **StrideSync** is a wearable device designed to help paired runners maintain the same pace, even when physically apart. It was developed collaboratively with my classmates.  

  - **Functionality**: Two users wear visors that compare their running speeds using GPS data. The visors communicate via a web server hosted on Raspberry Pi devices, displaying dynamic lights to signal whether the users should speed up or slow down. This keeps the runners synchronized without needing to stay close to each other.  
  - **Design Process**: We integrated software, hardware, and design tools to create both the functionality and the accompanying poster for the project.
